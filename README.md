# completometer
This is a repository to support a research paper:

Zliobaite, I and Fortelius, M. (2021). Completeness of the mammalian fossil record revisited. In review. 

For the time being the code is not extensively cdocumented, I hope to improve that upon publication of the manuscript. The structure of the repository is:

    1_fossil_data_preprocessing
The folder contains present day biodiversitydataset and dumps of NOW database and PBDB used for counting fossil species for this analysis. The folder also contains R scripts for data preprocessing.

    2_fossil_data_analysis
Contains a spreadsheet with completeness estimates under five scenarios (different assumptions about species duration and standing diversity).

    3_simulation_experiment
The folder contains scripts for synthetic analysis of relationships between fossil preservation, species duration and relative abundances. This analysis is in the appendix of the manuscript under review.
